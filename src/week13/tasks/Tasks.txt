Week 13 Java Office Hours Topics:
* Inheritance : Implement the classes of Item, OnSaleItem and TJMax, instructions are included inside each class.
* Final Keyword: With Variables, Methods, Classes, Arrays and ArrayLists
* Abstraction: We will use abstractionExample.png file which is included in this tasks package to create and review abstraction in Java

Inheritance: builds is-A relationship
What can be inherited?
- all public/protected variables and methods
- all default var and methods can be inherited only if they are in the same package

What can NOT be inherited?
- private vars and methods
- final class
- constructors ? we can call them

No Multiple Inheritance between classes, possible with Interfaces

Constructor in Inheritance:
- parent class constructor always executes before child class constructor
- call with super() method
- if you have only constructor with parameters at the parent class, child class has no choice but call for that constructor

Rules of Method Over-Riding:
- needs is-A relation
- private, static, final methods can NOT be over-riden HOWEVER we can overload them
- Same name and same parameters
- More visible access modifiers
- for primitives same return type, for object same or co-variant type
