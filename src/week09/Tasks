1. Write a method that accepts an array and prints the number of even numbers in the
array.
int[] x = {2,1,2,3,4} = > 3
int[] y = {2,2,0} = > 3
int[] z = {1,3,5} = > 0

2.Write a method that accepts an array and print the difference between the largest and
smallest values in the array.
int[] x = {10,3,5,6} = > 7
int[] y = {7,2,10,9} = > 8
int[] z = {2,10,7,2} = > 8

3. Write a Java program to create a new array list, add some colors (string) and print out the collection by iterate through all elements in a array list. 

4. Write a Java program to insert an element into the array list at the first position. Then retrieve an element (at a specified index) from the array list. Then update specific array element by given element. Lastly remove the third element from the array list. 

5. (Use Collections Utility Class) Search an element in a array list then sort the given array list. Copy one array list into another. Shuffle elements in a array list. Reverse elements in a array list. 

6. Write a Java program to extract a portion of a array list. Then compare these two array lists. 

7. Write a Java program of swap two elements in an array list. 

8. Write a Java program to clone an array list to another array list. Then join these two array lists. 

9. Write a Java program to empty an array list then test if array list is empty or not.
