 **** 3 buddies of Initialization
What is the difference between static block and Constructor?
 - Both initialize fields
 - Static block is used for static fields and constructor runs whenever we create an object, static block runs only once when class is loading


 * we have one more initializer, and that one is Init Block: this one is runs each time we create an object, before constructor

 Method Overloading: same name different parameters

 Encapsulation: Data-hiding, private access modifier for fields, and public getter/setters
        - to prevent invalid entries
        - you can have at both getter and setter some rules
