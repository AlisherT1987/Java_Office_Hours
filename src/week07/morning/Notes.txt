Task-1
The class HouseItems holds a few attributes and has a method called toString. The attributes are name and color -both are strings and amount which is an int. toString returns a string showing all the Atts in a format.
for example:
HouseItems a = new HouseItems();
a.name = "table";
a.color = "brown";
a.amount = 1;
System.out.println(a.toString());
name: table color: brown amount: 1
Create the required attributes and method inside the HouseItems class

Task-2
version 1: without instance variables and no setInfo method
Create a "MyCalculator" class that has instance methods which can do simple math operations on two numbers. The methods are: plus, minus, multiply and divide.
All the methods get two ints then the method does the required math operation and returns the result as an int.

In version one we just have instance methods with parameters (actions) no attributes of the class
