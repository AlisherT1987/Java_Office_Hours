This week's Office Hours Tasks and Topics:
    - Give examples on:
        * Exception handling in JAVA
        * Checked and Unchecked exceptions
        * Custom exception tasks
            - create a custom exception class that will enable us to use following statement:
            throw new InsufficientBalanceException("Transaction declined. Not enough funds :(");

    - Collections Review and practice:
        * Task: Iterate through different Collections Data Structure using:
            - all iteration methods, and also iterator, to find a certain data exists in that collection

        * Task:
         For compiler one of the most important task is balanced brackets
            * Create a method that will accept a String of brackets. Determine if the brackets are balanced.
            Brackets are balanced if the closing bracket matches the opening one.

            Ex: {([])} -> balanced
                {[(])} -> not balanced

            Hint: Use stack
