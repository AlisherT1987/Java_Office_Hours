As a Tester/Developer
What are the attributes of good test automation framework?
- Re-Usability
- Code quality
- Maintainability: in terms of making changes you can do it quickly and easily
        *** You need to have Classes(Blueprint or Utility Type classes)
        *** You change one attribute value and it changes automatically all object values
- Readable:  codes by everyone even for First Comers to the company
- When you are doing copy paste: make sure that you don't have errors and make sure it does not look it is copy pasted.

Creating Methods: crating a function for an operation
syntax:
    Access-Modifiers Specifier returnType methodName( might have parameters){
                code statements;
    }
Access-Modifiers: public (accessible from everywhere), protected, default, private (accessible only in the same class)
Specifiers: static
to call a method:
        instance method : through object call it
        static method : either with class name or object (bad practice)

Constructors : special methods, used for instantiate/create an object
            how to call: with new keyword
            Every class MUST have
            syntax:
            Access-Modifier ClassName(parameter){
            *** these parameters can be used to initialize your attributes
            statements;
            }

instance variables: each object has its own copy, belongs to that specific object created, multiple copies of the value
static variables : one copy of the value, all the objects share the same value

PIQ: What is the difference between this keyword and this() method?
this: a keyword, when we want to refer to object of the instance
        it is used for calling instance variables and methods
this() : a method to call the constructor
